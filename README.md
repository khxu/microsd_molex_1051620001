# KiCad Footprint for 1051620001

~~Disclaimer: the footprint seems to match the 3D model, but no guarantees about its accuracy. Make sure you double check before using it. Otherwise, this footprint will definitely not save you time.~~

Update October 24, 2020: footprint works great! Haven't used this in any boards that required the DAT2 and DAT1 lines (pads 8 and 1, respectively), but the part lines up perfectly with the pads.
